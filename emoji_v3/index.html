        <!--======== INFORMED CONSENT FORM ========-->
        <div class='pageBox' id='consentBox'>
            <div class='consentInstr'>To conduct this experiment, we need to include this information sheet:</div>
            <div class='formArea'>
                <strong>CONSENT FORM</strong><br /><br />
                You are invited to participate in a research study on human vision, conducted by Hongjing Lu, PhD, of the Dept. of Psychology at UCLA. You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you have normal or corrected vision and are 18 years of age or older. For scientific reasons, this consent form does not include complete information about the study hypotheses and the research questions being tested. You will be fully debriefed following your participation in the research.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Purpose of Study</strong><br />
                The purpose of the study is to understand human perception and cognition.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Procedures Involved in Study</strong><br />
                If you agree to participate, you may receive a demographic questionnaire to collect information of your age, gender, ethnicity, and language. You may be presented with images or videos on a computer screen. You will answer simple questions and/or perform simple tasks by interacting with a website via a keyboard or a computer mouse. Your responses will be recorded by the computer and will not be identified with you in any way. The session will take 60 minutes.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Potential Risks and Discomforts</strong><br />
                There is no known risk/discomfort in this study. If you experience any discomfort during the experiment, you can stop at any time and notify the experimenter.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Potential Benefits to Subject </strong><br />
                There are no direct benefits from participating in this study.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Potential Benefits to Society</strong><br />
                Understanding how we create the representation of objects based on visual and linguistic cues is important to explain our fundamental skill of recognizing objects around us. It can help future researchers to understand how we represent objects, how we categorize them, and how we construct conceptual knowledge.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Payment for Participation</strong><br />
                You will receive 1 hour of credit for your psychology class if you signed up for the study through the UCLA Psychology Department Subject Pool; otherwise you will receive the payment in the rate of $10 per hour for your participation.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Alternatives to Participation</strong><br />
                An alternative to participating in this project and fulfilling Psychology 10 requirements is to participate in other research or to do an equivalent classroom project.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Confidentiality</strong><br />
                Your identity in this study will be treated as confidential. The results of the study, including laboratory or any other data, may be published for scientific purposes but will not include any identifiable references to you.
                <br /><br />
                The researchers will do their best to make sure that your private information is kept confidential. Information about you will be handled as confidentially as possible, but participating in research may involve a loss of privacy and the potential for a breach in confidentiality. Study data will be physically and electronically secured.  As with any use of electronic means to store data, there is a risk of breach of data security. Your data, including de-identified data may be kept for use in future research.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Participation and Withdraw</strong><br />
                Your participation is VOLUNTARY. You may withdraw from the experiment at any time without suffering any negative consequences. You may refuse to answer any questions that you do not want to answer and still remain in the study.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Identification of Investigators</strong><br />
                If you have any questions, feel free to contact Dr. Hongjing Lu (hongjing@ucla.edu), at the Department of Psychology, UCLA, 405 Hilgard Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90095-1563.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Rights of Research Subjects </strong><br />
                You may withdraw your consent at any time and discontinue participation without penalty.  You are not waiving any legal claims, rights or remedies because of your participation in this research study.

            We are studying how humans represent objects and concepts. We are studying emojis because they contain rich visual information and are commonly used in linguistic contexts. We are testing it using a similarity judgment task. Two emojis can be similar in multiple ways: color, shape, meaning, emotion etc.<br /><br />

            If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the researcher Hongjing Lu at hongjing@g.ucla.edu.
